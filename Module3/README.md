This module was developed using a **development journal** approach â€” more specifically, a [calculation journal](https://github.com/cloclacordis/rtos-eit-digital/tree/main/Module3/calculation) (whatever that may precisely mean). The journal contains a detailed record of the Module 3 assignment formulation, the problem-solving process, and implementation decisions.

For more information about the assignments, solutions, and the journal itself, see:

- [English-language version](https://github.com/cloclacordis/rtos-eit-digital/blob/main/Module3/calculation/CalcJourEN.md),  
- [Russian-language version](https://github.com/cloclacordis/rtos-eit-digital/blob/main/Module3/calculation/CalcJourRU.md).

Code examples (`.py` scripts) that appear throughout the **calculation journal** have been extracted into [a separate folder](https://github.com/cloclacordis/rtos-eit-digital/tree/main/Module3/scripts) for convenient execution and experimentation.
